            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li>
                    <strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a
                    Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this
                    left scars on me."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget
                    cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him
                    about breeding pest-resistent plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is
                    rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                    disinfectants, and other applied science.
                </li>
